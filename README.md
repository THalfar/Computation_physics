These are the codes from the Computation Physics course I took during my years at TUT. I found the course incredibly engaging and thoroughly enjoyed its assignments. Unfortunately, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic made it a particularly challenging period for me. The course was left incomplete as I struggled significantly with the social isolation brought on by the pandemic.
